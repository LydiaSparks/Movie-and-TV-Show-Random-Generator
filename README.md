# Movie-and-TV-Show-Random-Generator

This was a project I started in the summer of 2022. I had been delving deep into C++ before I started my first semester of college as a computer science major. I used this project to work with many of the aspects of the C++ programming language, like classes, libraries, arrays, user-defined functions, and so on. Through trial-and-error with this project, I was able to learn much more about the language rather than just reading or watching videos.

This was written in the Visual Studio IDE. It is a console-based program, and its function is to generate a movie for the user based on the user's preferences. If a user chooses the movie generator option, then the program will ask the user to choose a genre, and then it will ask the user to choose a subgenre. Each subgenre contains five different film titles that are randomly generated. If the user chooses the TV show generator option, then the program will ask the user to pick a genre, and each genre has five film titles that are randomly generated. 

I wanted to combine my love of film with my passion for programming, so I put my heart and soul into this first major project I've completed.
